# Collatz_Conjecture
In the summer of 2020 I read a book about 100 cool math discoveries. One of which goes as follows:
"The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

You can't prove Collatz conjecture mathematically, but I wrote a program in Java to see the conjecture at work. 

Try it on your own before you check out my code.
